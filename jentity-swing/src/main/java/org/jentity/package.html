Contains components for building a MVC GUI. The idea is to extends the default swing 
components with functionality for binding to a <code>DataEntity</code> model. The structure
of a UI bean component is shown in :<p>

The participating entities are:
<ul>
<li> View: Represents the visible component the user interacts with. This will typically be a swing
component. View components should not be shared.
<li> Controller: The controller has the responsibility of handling userinput and processing the
events into model updates. Controller components should not be shared. It is the controllers 
responsibility to ensure that each user event will result in only one model update event. 
<li> Processor: To be able to change controller processing, the controller delegates model change
processing to it's associated processor. The processor is of the type <code>DataEntityProcessor</code>.
<code>DataEntityProcessor</code> objects are compositions and can therefore be extended with 
any extra functionality needed. Each controller has one root processor which can have any number 
of subprocessors. Processors are stateless and should be shared.
<li> UI Bean: Logical structure containing a view and it's bindings to the model. An GUI bean always
contains a view. If the view should reflect data contained in the model, it also will contain
a model listener which processes model updates into view changes. If the bean provides functionality for 
modifying the model a controller will handle this.
<li> Model: The common point of interaction for the UI system is the shared model, which contains all
all data need to be exchange between the participating components. The model notifies all model
listeners each time a model change occurs. The model is the only state in the UI component which
is shared.
</ul>
